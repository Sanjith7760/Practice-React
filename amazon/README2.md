 🌟 React Practice Project: Amazon Shopping Process 🌟

In this project, I practiced building a simplified Amazon shopping experience using React. 
🛒 The flow includes selecting an item 🏷️, 
adding it to the cart 🛍️, proceeding to checkout 💳, 
and completing the payment 💰. 
This hands-on project helped me strengthen my understanding of the useState hook and other fundamental React concepts. 🚀
